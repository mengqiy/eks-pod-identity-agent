// Every constant below is shared with something outside this agent: the Pod
// Identity webhook, the CSI driver, or EKS Auth. None of them are tunable, and
// none of them may be copied as a literal into pkg/ or internal/. A drift in any
// one of them is a cluster-wide failure rather than a local bug, because the
// symptom surfaces in the workload rather than here.
//
// The socket triple is the sharpest example. The webhook injects
// SpiffeEnvVarEndpointSocket pointing at WorkloadIdentitySocketPath and mounts a
// volume named WorkloadIdentitySocketVolumeName at
// WorkloadIdentitySocketMountPath; the CSI driver publishes that directory; the
// agent listens on the socket inside it. If the three disagree, every enrolled
// pod fails to get a credential and the operator sees a workload that cannot
// dial its socket, which reads as an application bug.

	// SpiffeEnvVarEndpointSocket, so the scheme does not belong in this value.

	// It is deliberately a constant rather than a flag:
	// making it configurable invites an operator to set it and break the
	// webhook contract silently, and the only party that could legitimately
	// change it is the webhook, which cannot be reconfigured from here.
