package workloadidentity

// Metric and label names for the workload identity path.
//
// These are declared here, ahead of any implementation, so that every tier emits
// consistently and no tier invents a second convention. This file holds names
// only: no collectors, no registration, no init. Each tier registers its own
// collectors against the names below.
//
// The existing agent metrics are pod_identity_cache_errors,
// pod_identity_cache_state, pod_identity_local_validation and
// pod_identity_http_response. The workload identity path uses the distinct
// prefix "workload_identity_" instead. It is a separate feature namespace and is
// deliberately not folded into pod_identity_, so that dashboards and alarms for
// the AWS credentials path and the SPIFFE path can be reasoned about apart.

// Metric names. Each comment names the task that owns the collector and the
// label set it registers with.
