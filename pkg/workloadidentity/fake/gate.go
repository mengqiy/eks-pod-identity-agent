// Package fake holds a hand-written fake for every interface declared in
// pkg/workloadidentity, so each tier of the workload identity path can be unit
// tested without importing any other tier.
//
// The fakes are hand-written rather than generated because every one of them has
// to do four things a generated mock does not: return a canned value, return an
// error, count calls, and park an in-flight call until a test releases it. The
// last one is what makes the notification and renewal tiers testable, and it is
// provided by the embedded Gate.
//
// Every fake is safe for concurrent use and safe under the race detector. Every
// fake is usable as a zero-valued struct literal, so a test that needs one
// canned answer writes one line.
//
// One tie-break rule applies to every fake. A call parked at the gate wakes on
// Release, returning nil, or on its own context being cancelled, returning that
// context's error. Release wins a tie: a call that is released before it notices
// its context is done returns nil even when the two happen too close together to
// order, so a test may release a call whose context is expiring and still assert
// success. A call whose context is done before the Release still reports the
// context's error.
//
// One ordering rule applies to every fake. Gate.Release settles the Gate's own
// parked count before it returns, so Blocked is exact immediately afterwards, but
// it does not settle a fake's call counters: a released call still has to be
// scheduled before it counts and records itself. A test that drives a fake from
// another goroutine and then asserts on anything that call records, whether a
// counter such as Attestor.Calls, BundleSource.X509BundlesCalls or
// Subscriber.SubscribeCalls or a recording such as Workloads, Conns or Requests,
// must first observe the call's own return, usually by receiving the call's
// result from a channel the goroutine writes to.

// timing are concurrency behaviour, and testing either needs a call held open at
// a known point.
//
// A Gate is open by default, so a fake that is never told to block behaves like
// a plain stub. A Gate is reusable: Block after Release parks calls again.
//
// A parked call also gives up if its own context is cancelled, reporting that
// context's error. Release wins a tie, as described on the package: a call that
// is released before it notices its context is done returns nil.
//
// A Gate must not be copied once it has been used, because it holds a mutex and
// a condition variable bound to that mutex. Embed it and take the fake by
// pointer, which is how every fake in this package is written.
