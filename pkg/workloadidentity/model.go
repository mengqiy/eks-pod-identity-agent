// Package workloadidentity declares the interface seams and domain types of the
// workload identity path: attestation, token minting, AWS session exchange,
// SVID issuance, trust bundle distribution, and change notification.
//
// The shapes deliberately track the SPIFFE Workload API rather than being
// invented. Where the API returns a repeated field, so does the interface, even
// where the agent only ever produces one entry at launch. Where the API carries
// a field the agent does not use yet, such as Hint, it is present rather than
// dropped. The gRPC handlers are a thin adapter onto these types, and every
// place the internal shape diverges from the wire shape becomes a translation in
// the handler and a reshaping later.
//
// This package holds no behaviour: no methods, no constructors, no state. The
// one function it declares, MetricNames in metrics.go, returns the list of
// declared metric names so callers can enumerate it.

// BundleSource yields trust material. It is node-scoped, not per workload.

// together. An implementation fetches once, caches once, and exposes these views
