// Package grpcserver serves the workload identity APIs over a Unix domain socket.
//
// It is the gRPC counterpart of pkg/server, which is HTTP throughout: that
// package's registration type hands back an http.HandlerFunc and its middleware is
// http.HandlerFunc shaped, so none of it ports. The two server types have exactly
// one thing in common, which is their lifecycle: both listen until a context is
// cancelled and both can name what they are bound to. That is the interface cmd
// drives them through.
//
// Two things here have no counterpart on the HTTP path and are the substance of
// the package. Socket housekeeping, because a socket file outlives the process that
// bound it. And a bounded graceful stop, because the streams this server hosts are
// open for the life of the calling pod by design, so an unbounded drain waits for
// the kubelet's SIGKILL rather than for the clients.

	// on the socket itself grants nothing, which is why this is 0666 rather than
	// the 0777 SPIRE uses.
	//
	// It is set explicitly because the bind applies the process umask, so leaving
	// it alone means the mode is whatever the image happens to be built with:
	// 0755 under the usual 0022, which no workload running as another user can
	// connect to.
	//
	// The mode is the first gate and not the gate. What protects the socket is
	// attestation: every RPC resolves its caller through
	// workloadidentity.Attestor, and a caller that cannot be resolved to a pod on
	// this node gets nothing.
	SocketMode os.FileMode = 0o666

	// socketDirMode is the mode of the socket's parent directory when the agent
	// has to create it. 0755 gives the search bit reaching the socket needs, and

	// which turns a denial of service into an impersonation of the agent.

	// SIGTERM spends the whole budget and then escalates. The HTTP servers get away
	// with a long budget because their requests finish in milliseconds; this one does
	// not.
	//
	// And the budget has to fit inside the DaemonSet's terminationGracePeriodSeconds,
	// which is 30 seconds in the chart. Together with forcedStopWait, 35 would put
	// the escalation, the socket cleanup and the agent's own exit after the kubelet's
	// SIGKILL, so none of it would ever run on a node.
	//
	// What a drain actually buys on this socket is letting an in-flight unary call
	// finish, which takes milliseconds. Five seconds is generous for that and leaves
	// the rest of the grace period to the other servers. SPIRE's agent does not drain
	// this socket at all, and its server bounds the same pattern at ten seconds.

	// thing that can still hold it up is a handler goroutine no cancellation reaches,
