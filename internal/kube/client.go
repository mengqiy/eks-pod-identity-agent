// Package kube builds the Kubernetes client the workload identity path reaches
// the API server with, and resolves the agent's own node name from it.
//
// The client authenticates as the node identity (system:node:<nodeName>) rather
// than as the agent's ServiceAccount. That is what makes the node-scoped reads
// and writes safe: the Node authorizer restricts a node identity to the pods
// bound to its own node, a property no ServiceAccount and RBAC grant can express.
// Both consumers depend on it — the attestor's pod watch and node-name lookup
// (T3), and the token minter's TokenRequest (T4) — so the client is built once
// here and injected into both rather than each constructing its own. One
// construction means one credential path, one connection pool, and one rate
// limiter bounding the agent's total traffic to the API server.
//
// internal/validation/apiserver_client.go still builds its own client from
// rest.InClusterConfig() (the agent's ServiceAccount) for JWKS fetching, which
// does not require the node identity. Whether that path also moves onto the node
// credential is a deliberate T4 decision, not something to fold in by accident.
