package attestation

// NewAttestor is the startup wiring for attestation: start the node-scoped pod
// store over an already-built node-credentialed client and return an Attestor
// over it. It blocks until the pod cache syncs or ctx is done, because the agent
// cannot attest anything without a synced store; the server (T2) stays unready
// until this returns.
//
// The clientset and node name are injected rather than built here. They are
// produced once at startup by internal/kube (NewNodeClient + ResolveNodeName)
// and shared with the token minter (T4), so a single node credential, connection
// pool and rate limiter cover every node-credentialed consumer.
